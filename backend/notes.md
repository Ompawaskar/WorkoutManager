Express plays a vital role in the MERN stack by providing a secure, efficient, and scalable way to handle HTTP requests, enforce business logic, manage data validation and sanitization, and act as an intermediary between the frontend and MongoDB. Direct communication between the frontend and MongoDB would bypass these critical functionalities, leading to potential security risks, inefficiencies, and maintenance challenges.

const app = express(); // Express is a function which returns an object app. app has props like app.get ... defined in the express obj.
